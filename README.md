Secure chat room for sensitive communication

Created by StarfishCodeMachine, August 22, 2019

I built this program so that staff could communicate in a secure chat room.
The program does not rely on internet protocols, it simply writes to and reads from a text file in a secure network folder.
All communications are retained for future review. 
Hopefully this will prevent inadvertently sharing sensitive information through email in day-to-day communications between staff.    

They will probably never use it.

Requirements:
1. tkinter
2. To make the .exe you need PyInstaller. The install.bat file has the correct parameters for a windowed onefile .exe with my silly picture for the icon   

Instructions:
1. Copy the Python 3.7 file into a local or network folder and run it from the command prompt. 
2. If you want to create an .exe, copy install.bat and the ICO file into the same folder and run the bat file.
