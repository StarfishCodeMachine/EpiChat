# EpiChat
A simple, text file based chat room for communication, written in Python 3.7.

I built this program as an alternate to email and other proprietary communication systems. It is not secure. Chat data is stored in an easily accessible file. The program does not rely on internet protocols, it simply writes to and reads from a text file in a network folder.

Requirements:
1. tkinter and PyInstaller
 
Installation Instructions:
1. Copy EpiChat_v20190828a.py, chat.ico, and install.bat to a network folder.
2. Inside EpiChat_v20190828a.py change the "chatLogLocation" on line 26 to the folder location e.g. 'k:\\chatlogs\\' 
3. Run install.bat
