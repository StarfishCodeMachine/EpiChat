Secure chat room for sensitive communication

Created by StarfishCodeMachine, August 22, 2019

I built this program so that staff could communicate in a secure chat room.
The program does not rely on internet protocols, it simply writes to and reads from a text file in a secure network folder.
All communications are retained for future review. 
Hopefully this will prevent inadvertently sharing sensitive information through email in day-to-day communications between staff.    

They will probably never use it.
